# Open API

This repository hosts [Open API](https://swagger.io/specification/) documents for third party services that do not currently provide this documentation directly.

The documents are provided to the best of our ability based on any public API documentation. It may be incomplete or outdated. Pull Requests to update or extend any documentation are welcome.

This site is deployed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
