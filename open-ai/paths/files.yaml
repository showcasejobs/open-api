                  Name of the JSON Lines file to be uploaded.

                  If the purpose is set to "search" or "answers", each line is a JSON record with a "text" field and an optional "metadata" field.
                  Only "text" field will be used for search.
                  Specially, when the purpose is "answers", "\n" is used as a delimiter to chunk contents in the "text" field into multiple documents for finer-grained matching.

                  If the purpose is set to "classifications", each line is a JSON record with a single training example with "text" and "label" fields along with an optional "metadata" field.
