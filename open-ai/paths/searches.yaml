    summary: Create search
    description: |
      The search endpoint computes similarity scores between provided query and documents.
      Documents can be passed directly to the API if there are no more than 200 of them.

      To go beyond the 200 document limit, documents can be processed offline and then used for efficient retrieval at query time.
      When `file` is set, the search endpoint searches over all the documents in the given file and returns up to the `max_rerank` number of documents.
      These documents will be returned along with their search scores.

      The similarity score is a positive score that usually ranges from 0 to 300 (but can sometimes go higher), where a score above 200 usually means the document is semantically similar to the query.

                  Up to 200 documents to search over, provided as a list of strings.

                  The maximum document length (in tokens) is 2034 minus the number of tokens in the query.

                  You should specify either `documents` or a `file`, but not both.
                example:
                  - White House
                  - hospital
                  - school

                  The ID of an uploaded file that contains documents to search over.

                  You should specify either `documents` or a `file`, but not both.

                  Query to search against the documents.

                  The maximum number of documents to be re-ranked and returned by search.

                  This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.

                  A special boolean flag for showing metadata.
                  If set to true, each document entry in the returned JSON will contain a "metadata" field.

                  This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.
