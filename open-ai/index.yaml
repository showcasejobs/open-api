  - name: Engines
    description: |
      Engines describe and provide access to the various models available in the API.
      You can refer to the [Engines](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines) documentation to understand what engines are available and the differences between them.

  - name: Completions
    description: |
      Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions, and can also return the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position.
  - name: Searches
    description: |
      Given a query and a set of documents or labels, the model ranks each document based on its semantic similarity to the provided query.

  - name: Classifications
    description: |
      Given a query and a set of labeled examples, the model will predict the most likely label for the query.
      Useful as a drop-in replacement for any ML classification or text-to-label task.

  - name: Answers
    description: |
      Given a question, a set of documents, and some examples, the API generates an answer to the question based on the information in the set of documents.
      This is useful for question-answering applications on sources of truth, like company documentation or a knowledge base.

  - name: Files
    description: |
      Files are used to upload documents that can be used across features like [Answers](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/answers), [Search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches), and [Classifications](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/classifications).
